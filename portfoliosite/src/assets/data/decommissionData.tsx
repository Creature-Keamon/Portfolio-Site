          Decommission is a small, proof of concept game where you, the player,
          is a scrapper whose job it is to salvage valuable parts from old and
          progressively larger and larger spacecraft. The larger the space ship,
          the more valuables are inside, but require different tools to access.

          <p></p>Team Leader,<p></p> and 3D modeller.

          From the ground up we wanted it to be a cozy, relaxing experience, so
          this needed to be reflected in both the gameplay mechanics and the
          visual aesthetics. For design, we chose a warm colour tone with a
          small palette, and made all important elements starkly contrast
          against the background without breaking style.

          The player has access to multiple tools (and would be able to unlock
          more if this was a full game), each with their own use cases. However,
          we knew that if we designed our tools to be more realistic and
          representative of themselves in real life, it would introduce extra
          complexity, tedious-ness and the potential for some frustration.

          To ensure that our tools do not contrast against our cozy design
          aesthetics, we designed the tool interactions to be boiled down to the
          most basic (while still allowing for some nuance), but not boiled down
          so much that the game just plays itself.
          <p></p> I helped make the game fun, interesting to look at, and have
          interesting mechanics, while ensuring that the games' core and
          identity were not at all compromised on. <p></p> Decommission can be
          downloaded from Itch.io from the link above.
