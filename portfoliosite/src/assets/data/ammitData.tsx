        Ammit the Truth is a deduction/detective based visual novel style video
        game, using art styles influenced by games like 'Hades', and gameplay
        reminiscent of games like 'Papers Please'. It sees the player take the
        role of Anubis, the guardian of the egyptian afterlife, and he must
        interview and interrogate each soul who seeks to enter the afterlife to
        determine if they deserve entrance to the field of reeds or to be
        devoured by Ammit.

        Our team had some incredible talent, especially in the art department,
        and I am of the belief that our game is visually stunning. My
        contribution was all over the place. I did 3D art, programming and game
        design, but my greatest contributions were with project management,
        writing of dialogue and planning. Creating this game was truly a very
        enjoyable experience, but it was not without it's hiccups. Two of our
        team members had frustratingly poor communication and time management
        skills, and it was often the job of myself and our 2D artist to try and
        get them back on track, with great difficulty. Due to this, much of the
        game was finished the day before it was due to be handed in, placing us
        under a lot of stress.

        Despite these hiccups, the resulting game was rather enjoyable to play
        through, with some beautiful art to look at while doing so. I learnt
        some valuable lessons about how to manage unmotivated teammates and do
        project management. I am more experienced now with creating 3D models
        with optimised topology and in game design philosophy and principles.
