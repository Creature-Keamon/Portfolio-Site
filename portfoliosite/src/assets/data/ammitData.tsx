          Ammit the Truth is a deduction/detective based visual novel style
          video game, using art styles influenced by games like 'Hades', and
          gameplay reminiscent of games like 'Papers Please'. It sees the player
          take the role of Anubis, the guardian of the egyptian afterlife, and
          he must interview and interrogate each soul who seeks to enter the
          afterlife to determine if they deserve entrance to the field of reeds
          or to be devoured by Ammit.

          Our team had some incredible talent, especially in the art department,
          and I am of the belief that our game is visually stunning. My
          contribution was all over the place. I did 3D art, programming and
          game design, but my greatest contributions were with project
          management, writing of dialogue and planning. Creating this game was
          truly a very enjoyable experience, but it was not without it's
          hiccups. Two of our team members had frustratingly poor communication
          and time management skills, and it was often the job of myself and our
          2D artist to try and get them back on track, with great difficulty.
          Due to this, much of the game was finished the day before it was due
          to be handed in, placing us under a lot of stress.

          Despite these hiccups, the resulting game was rather enjoyable to play
          through, with some beautiful art to look at while doing so. I learnt
          some valuable lessons about how to manage unmotivated teammates and do
          project management. I am more experienced now with creating 3D models
          with optimised topology and in game design philosophy and principles.
